At Build-It Bend, we help homeowners transform their properties into valuable housing solutions. Oregon's housing crisis has created unique opportunities for property owners, with housing costs in Bend rising 50% in the last 5 years due to supply shortages. Recent changes to Oregon's housing regulations now allow more types of housing in more areas. Properties with single-family homes can now be developed into duplexes, triplexes, or accessory dwelling units (ADUs), offering up to 30% ROI for savvy property owners.

**Despite these opportunities, most homeowners face significant barriers:
**
- Limited awareness of new zoning possibilities
- Complex and difficult-to-navigate development codes
- Lack of expertise in financing, designing, and permitting

Build-It Bend hopes to removes these obstacles by providing:

A user-friendly platform to understand your property's potential
Simple explanation of land-use codes in minutes
Clear guidance on what housing types you can build
Connections to trusted local building professionals

## How It Works
Simply enter your address, and we'll do the work for you. Our technology breaks down complex land-use codes and shows you what's possible on your property. We then connect you with the resources needed to make it happen.

Build-it is a tool currently in development that helps Bend homeowners identify housing development opportinities by interpreting the Bend Development Code, providing documentation, and connecting them to services. The project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
